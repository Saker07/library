    FIXED?id cannot be just numbers, it creates problems with the css selectors, rather than taht use the data attribute.
    edit not working properly, if you edit it does get the details of the book, but once you apply it doesn't work, it actually deleted it? or overwrites it with blank? actually the add stops working after using the edit? wtf
    delete book function
    

    1. edit is not working, it just blanks the  item.
    2. after the edit add doesn't work anymore, only adds blanks.
